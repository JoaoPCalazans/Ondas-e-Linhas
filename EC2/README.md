# EC2

The 2nd programming exercise, about *Transmission lines in steady sinusoidal state: reflection and impedance matching*.
Include the following:

* [LaTeX](https://github.com/JoaoPCalazans/Ondas-e-Linhas/tree/main/EC2/LaTeX) (Folder): Tex code of outcome.

* [LTspice](https://github.com/JoaoPCalazans/Ondas-e-Linhas/tree/main/EC2/LTspice) (Folder): Resolution to Q2 in circuit simulation.

* [EC2_PTC3314](https://github.com/JoaoPCalazans/Ondas-e-Linhas/blob/main/EC2/EC2_PTC3314.pdf) (PDF): Outcome.

* [EP2 enunciado v2024](https://github.com/JoaoPCalazans/Ondas-e-Linhas/blob/main/EC2/EP2%20enunciado%20v2024.pdf) (PDF): Statement archive.

* [EC2](https://github.com/JoaoPCalazans/Ondas-e-Linhas/blob/main/EC2/EC2.m) (.m): Complete Octave/Matlab resolution. For item (b), uses try-and-error approximation in the impedance matching line position.

* [Q1](http://github.com/JoaoPCalazans/Ondas-e-Linhas/blob/main/EC2/Q1.m) (.m): Octave/Matlab code to question 1. For item (b), uses exact geometric line position for impedance matching.

* [Q2](https://github.com/JoaoPCalazans/Ondas-e-Linhas/blob/main/EC2/Q2.m) (.m): Octave/Matlab code complementary to question 2.

I'm not sure on what's the corrected version of code (complete or individual), so I upload both. I would try individuals first and compare outputs with outcome pdf.

Item (b) geometric resolution was not used, since it was created after the deadline. Should be equivalent, though.
