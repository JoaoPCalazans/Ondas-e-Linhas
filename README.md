Projects here may include exercice list resolutions and computational exercises (aka EC [Exercicíos Computacionais] or EP [Exercícios Programas]).

Always when possible i will try to make acessible a PDF containing its original statement. $\LaTeX$

Any suggestions, claims, love/hate declarations and/or music recommendations can send me here: [joao.calazans@usp.br](mailto:joao.calazans@usp.br)
