>The main objective of this discipline is to study the propagation of electromagnetic waves. In unbounded media, emphasis will be placed on steady-state solutions for sinusoidal excitation. In transmission lines (TEM mode), both transient and steady-state sinusoidal behaviors will be analyzed, and problems of reflection and impedance matching will be addressed. The learning objectives of this discipline are: I. Understand the phenomenon of electromagnetic wave propagation. II. Analyze electrical circuits associated with transmission lines. III. Estimate impedances of devices and structures in transmission lines.


This repository contains a collection of projects, made for the course of `PTC3314 - Waves and Lines (Ondas e Linhas)`, in the 2024 given.

Projects here may include exercice list resolutions and computational exercises (aka EC [Exercicíos Computacionais] or EP [Exercícios Programas]). Simulations made mainly in MATLAB, but some may use [MULTISIM](https://www.ni.com/en/shop/electronic-test-instrumentation/application-software-for-electronic-test-and-instrumentation-category/what-is-multisim.html?srsltid=AfmBOoq3XldDX_GX6sa1GzUISeYV--lJap98Fdi2DH8KgFH6vAnl7wtI), [ADS](https://www.keysight.com/us/en/products/software/pathwave-design-software/pathwave-advanced-design-system.html), $\LaTeX$ and paper resolutions, among others into different digital aplications.
Always when possible i will try to make acessible a PDF containing its original statement.

Any suggestions, claims, love/hate declarations and/or music recommendations can send me here: [joao.calazans@usp.br](mailto:joao.calazans@usp.br)

Repository still in development. He is still a child, take it easy on him.
